# Matrix_lib
Personnal library for operations on matrix and vector objects.

-- ABOUT --

This library contains useful methods to use on matrix (or vector) objects.
You are free to use it, just remove or change the credits. Also keep in mind that I coded it for a personnal use so the code may be a bit strange sometimes.

-- USE --

Add the line "import matrix_lib" to your .py file to use fonctions from the library.

That's it, have fun !
